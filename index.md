## Lyrics

#### When I look into your eyes
#### I can see a love restrained
#### But darlin', when I hold you
#### Don't you know I feel the same?
#### Yeah
#### Nothin' lasts forever
#### And we both know hearts can change
#### And it's hard to hold a candle
#### In the cold November rain
